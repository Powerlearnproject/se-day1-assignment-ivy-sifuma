Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the creation of reliable, innovative software solutions that meet our needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as C that have helped in software development.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline that has led to great revolutions in the tech industry
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s which has allowed collaboration across the globe.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements which is the gathering and documentation of user needs
2. Design where high designs are created for the user interface
3. Implementation where you write code and build the software.
4. Testing, you run tests to ensure the software meets quality standards
5. Deployment, releasing the software to users.
6. maintenance, providing updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies have a sequential approach while agile is focused on flexibility and responds to change. Waterfall will be best used in a bridge or road construction where there is a specific flow of events to be followed from requirements to design while agile can be used in mobile app development where user preferences are bound to evolve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer will design, develop, debug, and document the software while a quality assurance engineer will test and defect management to ensure it's working and improvements done as needed, a project manager ensures there is project planning, risk management, resource management and great coordination and communication within the team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and VCS help in code editing, debugging, and testing of code. Examples of IDEs and VCS are Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA(GIT) respectively.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Unclear requirements as a challenge can be solved by having proper documentation by the stakeholders
2. Poor code quality which can be resolved by having consistency in code styles and frequent reviews


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - Focuses on the function of the software ensuring each code works and this helps identify issues with code early in development
2. Integration testing - tests the interaction between components of the software ensuring that the integrated components function properly after combinantion.
3. System testing - tests the complete integrated software application which allows holistic validation ensuring the entire system works correctly and meets specific requirements
4. Acceptance testing - tests the software from the end user to ensure it works correctly as per requirements and ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting instructions in a precise way to get the best response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example. Where do cats live? Improved example; Where do mountain cats live?  The improved prompt is more effective because then we know which cats as the cat family is very wide.
